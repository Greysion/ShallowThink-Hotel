# Shallowthink-Hotel
 
 A game made in under 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2020.
 
 It's a clicker game. You click a CPU to upgrade its processing power, purchasing upgrades to improve its management capabilities of smart hotel.
 
 The more you click, the more powerful it gets, the more people working on its processing power, the more rooms you can reopen, the more bugbytes who live there.
